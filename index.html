            <h1 class="heading">Welcome!</h1>
            <h3 class="heading">Thank you for your interest in the AL-PUB Dataset.</h3>
            <p>
                AL-PUB contains 195,683 tightly cropped images of characters from ancient Greek
                Papyri. The dataset was developed using volunteer crowdsourced annotations of 12,070 
                manuscript fragments from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri collection. The annotations are a 
                product of the Ancient Lives Project and include samples from all 24 characters in the 
                standard Greek alphabet. AL-PUB is a subset of the currently unpublished AL-ALL Dataset. 
                Roughly half of AL-ALL are from currently unpublished manuscripts and due to image rights 
                and ongoing papyrological research cannot be made publicly available at this time. Both 
                datasets were developed with machine learning and optical character recognition in mind
                and we hope the dataset will be a valuable alternative to other large scale machine learning, character image 
                datasets, especially for digital humanities research. This project is a collaboration 
                of Middle Tennesssee State University, The University of Tennessee, The 
                University of Kentucky, and The University of Minnesota.

            <p>
                This research is made possible by the thousands of Zooniverse volunteers who participated in the Ancient Lives project over the past decade. We recognize these 
                volunteers and thank them for their efforts in spurring advances not only across the humanities, but also, now, the sciences. We also thank the
                Imaging Papyri Project at the University of Oxford for providing access to the digitized manuscript images as well as the Egyptian Exploration Society 
                for providing access to the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. This research was partially funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and The Chellgren Center for 
                Undergraduate Excellence.
